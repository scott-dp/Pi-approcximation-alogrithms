<h2>For running on a windows system:</h2>
To use the gmp library download the gmp files using https://www.msys2.org/ and use the command: "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gmp". The gmp files will now be in your mingw bundle, and in the cmake file set the absolute path to your mingw/include and mingw/lib folders on line 6 and 7. If using an editor like clion, make sure the toolchain is set up to the bundle with gmp files downloaded.

<h3>For running on unix based system gmp.h will be available without any action.</h3>
