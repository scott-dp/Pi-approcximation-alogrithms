CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "MinGW Makefiles".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to select a different build tool.
CMake Error: CMAKE_C_COMPILER not set, after EnableLanguage
